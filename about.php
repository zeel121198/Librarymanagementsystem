      <small>               Library management tracks all the operations performed in a library, including number of books. 
                            Our Online Library management is suitable for both schools and colleges and it is easy and less time consuming.
                            This application helps librarians to catalogue books and maintain their records of issued, reissued and overdue books. 
                            It also maintains date of issue and return of a book.
